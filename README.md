# CSCE155N_final
This function does not require any inputs in the command line; all inputs 
are to be entered in the GUI. First, select a gas from the list or choose 
"Other Gas." When one of the built-in gases is chosen, the program 
automatically determines the critical temperature and pressure values based
on information from engineeringtoolbox.com. If "Other Gas" is chosen, then 
a pop-up box will appear to prompt a manual input of the critical 
temperature and pressure values. Then, type a numerical value in the text 
boxes labeled "Input Temperature (K)" and "Input Pressure (atm)" to input 
the values of temperature and pressure respectively. Be sure that the 
correct units are used. When all values are inputted, click "Calculate 
Compressibility (Z)" to calculate the compressibility value of the gas.
